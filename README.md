Code assignment

Its Java Project

I did this requirement with Facade design pattern. Its an structural design pattern.

Clone this projet into your IDE. Use java 8 version since i used concept of default methods in interfaces.

I have created 1 interface with default methods then created implementation classes with required functions.

I have created one facade class which maintain object for each implementation class.

Lastly created Main class which can satisfy all your requirements. 

1. Create object for Facde classs by passing implementation class objects as parameters to the constuctor.
2. Open MainClass right click then click on Run As then 1 Java Application. It shows output.

Do mail me if any difficulties to access project. Thank you
